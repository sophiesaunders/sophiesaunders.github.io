# Github hosted personal portfolio website

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website. This is a venture in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm not using any fancy web dev libraries so this is a very basic, one-page (so far) site. 

A lot of the source code here is a result of taking the class at https://careerfoundry.com/. Feel free to duplicate, modify, and make a similar site for yourself!

## Things of note

- The site has a "Contact Me" section with an HTML form that is set up to work through https://formspree.io/. It would have required a client-server relationship that exists outside of Github to make it work otherwise, and since I'm hosting this site through Github, I figured I'd use something that works out-of-the-box. It's free and it gives you a unique URL to embed so your email is kept private, but as a price for that free-ness there is a redirect page when the user submits the form, which cannot be changed (without premium). So far, I think it's very worth it.
- I spent a long time agonizing over color palettes and ended up using the AI tool https://www.khroma.co/ to find font + background color combinations I like. It's a great site for specifically picking font and background since it generates options that are displayed as such.
- This is certainly still a work in progress. Keep coming back to see more updates!

## To Do
- Add next two projects (college projects, or something new)
- Add my resume in "links" as PDF for download
- Consider adding more pages (i.e. one per project)
